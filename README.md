# Overview Keyboard Navigation Fix

Fix for GNOME Shell 40 and 41 keyboard spatial navigation in the Overview.

This extension only activates spatial navigation between windows and apps in the Avtivities Overview and App Grid using arrow keys.
It also makes Esc key leaves overview when pressed in App Grid (instead of switching to Window Overview).
