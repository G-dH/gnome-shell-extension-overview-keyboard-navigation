# Overview Keyboard Navigation Fix

Fix for GNOME Shell 40 and 41 keyboard spatial navigation in the Overview.

Originaly, if you press Tab or Down key in the activities overview or app grid overview, navigation using arrow keys and Tab should activate. This behavior have been broken since GNOME 40 release and fixed lately in 42.
This extension focuses the right object in the overview to initiate its keyboard navigation, when you press Tab or any arrow key while no item is selected.
It also changes Esc key behavior - when pressed in App Grid view it leaves the Overview instead of switching to Windows Overview.
